# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by replacing each letter in the plaintext message by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This fixed number is called the key. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
